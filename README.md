# Intensive Programming Workshop

## In-Class Work

### Lecture 3
Using tests with functions to implement

### Lecture 4
Using tests with Lecture 3 but done with Github Actions.

## Programming Exercises

### Project 1: Multidimensional Point Class
In this project, we delved into object-oriented programming in C++, focusing on key aspects:

-  **Point Class:** Implemented a `Point` class which represents and manipulates points in n-dimensional space.
-  **Methods:** Constructed the `Point` class methods for calculating Euclidean distance and translating coordinates.
-  **Error Handling:** Ensure system robustness by including error handling for situations where point dimensions might mismatch.
-  **Compilation & Clean-up:** Created an efficient Makefile to facilitate code compilation and clean-up process.
-  **Code Quality:** Strictly adhered to provided style guidelines, ensuring that the code is readable and maintainable.
