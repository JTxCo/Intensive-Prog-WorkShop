I was able to complete my Progress of getting these things done:
1.	Build the Board UI
2.	Build the buttons for the player operations
3.	Add player movement

I was not able to get the dice rolling functionality done. Instead of adding the Dice Rolling I added the completly functioning holding area.
Play movement is done but the button connection does not work yet. That will be part of the next objective.

The things left to do are:
1. Connect the buttons to the player movement
2. Add the dice rolling functionality
3. Add the player win condition
4. Add the player lose condition
5.	Add the shoots and ladders
    1. Add player movement to the ladders
6.	Add player switching, can go to next turn
7.	Add player signing in dialog
    1. Add multiple player signing in dialog
8.	Add 10 sec limit
9.	Add populating and inserting to CSV
10.	Leaderboard
11.	Add undo and EX stuff


While there appears a lot to do, the background functionality has been implemeented. Mostly the UI needs to just be connected
